ubyteparser:

        a simple bytecode interpreter. takes a list of bytes and performs
        actions based on their input. it uses a simple binary format called
        ".byte", which is essentially just a list of bytes, no operations or
        conversions performed on the original array, but rather a list of
        instructions is formed using it.
